a post it note or any other way to have a note on a device

duct tape

## how 2 complete

#### initial setup

find a post it note or something like tape and paper and write the ios ver u want to downgrade to 

then locate the nearest train tracks 

for best results, and to prevent damage to other items, move everything away from the tracks

#### the bypass

now is a good time to turn ur idevice or ipad is ON, then and put the note on the device 

and put the device on the train tracks, use duct tape to tape the deivce to the train tracks

wait for the train

after the train hits the device, get it, and itll be on that version
